## 🧳 Git Stash
- Git stash is used to temporarily save changes in your working directory that you don't want to commit immediately. It's like putting your work in a drawer to come back to later.

<br>

## 📌 Why Use Git Stash?

- You want to switch branches but have uncommitted changes.
- You’re in the middle of a task but need to fix something urgent on another branch.
- You want to test something without committing incomplete work.
