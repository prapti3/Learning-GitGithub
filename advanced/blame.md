# ðŸ‘€ git blame â€“ See Who Changed What, When, and Why
- git blame lets you track the history of each line in a file â€” who changed it, when, and in which commit.

<br>

### ðŸ§  Why Use git blame?
- Debug a specific line of code
- Find the author of a change
- Understand the context or purpose of a change
- Investigate when a bug was introduced

<br>

### ðŸ”§ Syntax
- `git blame <file>`
- You can also specify a line range:
   - `git blame -L 20,40 <file>`
   - This shows blame info only for lines 20 to 40.
